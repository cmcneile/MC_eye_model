# Simulations of geometric eye models

The scripts create spherical and ellispoid models with known
parameters. The aim is to create test data that can be used to check
fitting codes.

The output files are written to the directory **data** in
stl (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) and numpy format.

Python libraries required.

pip install pyvista[all]

The scripts below

* create_ellipsoid.py
* create_noisy_ellipsoid.py
* create_noisy_sphere.py
* create_sphere.py
